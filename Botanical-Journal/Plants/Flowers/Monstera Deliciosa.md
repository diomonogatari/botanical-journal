Aka Swiss Cheese Plant, known for its aerial roots and cuts in leaves. 

## ‚òÄÔ∏èEnvironment 
She thrives in bright, indirect sunlight but it can tolerate lower light conditions.
The more light she gets, the higher the growth rate and leaf fenestration.
However, **too much direct sunlight can scorch the leaves**.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è [[Pruning]]
When the leaves are dead or damaged they should be cut. This will promote healing and growth of new leaves stemming from there.
The plant **should not** be pruned more than 1/4 or 1/3 at a time.
Favorable seasons for pruning are late winter or early spring.

## [[Wiring & supporting]]
While this plant needs support due to the weight of her leaves and stems, she has naturally built-in features that facilitate this if done correctly.
I'm talking about its aerial roots. If you use a coco fiber moss pole, she will naturally grow her roots around the pole which will secure her without the need for wiring or ties. If you get an older/bigger plant, you can use the zip ties because the aerial roots develop slow.
As always, **regularly check ties to make sure they don't cut into the stems** due to plant weight.

## üíß [[Watering]]
This should only be done "on-demand", as in, when sticking a finger in the soil and feeling its try. Depending on the weather, this should be **every 1 or 2 weeks**.
Like most plants, over-watering can lead to root rot.
She, of course, thrives in a more humid environment (between 40% and 60%).
During the summer, I sprinkle its leaves with water when it's hot.

## [[Fertilizing]]
She should be fed with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer **3 to 4 times a year** during the growing season, which is spring and summer.
If growth slows in fall and winter the best is to reduce or pause the fertilization cycle, as the plant's nutrient needs decrease during these seasons.
(to search: slow-release fertilizer instead of water-soluble)

## üå±[[Re-potting]]
When it comes to re-potting, the most important thing to do, specially with a new plant, is to untangle the roots. After that, check if she was double-planted, just in case, you might have to split her between two different pots.
She should be re-potted **every 1 or 2 years**, or when the roots start to outgrow the pot or poke through drainage holes, if applicable.
Soil chosen should be well-draining and a peat-based mix amended with perlite or bark for aeration.
The best season to re-pot is during the spring or early summer to minimize stress and support new growht.
