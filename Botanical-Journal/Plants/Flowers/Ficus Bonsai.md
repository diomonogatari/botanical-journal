This species is one of the beginner recommended ones due to how much it can handle under-watering and over-watering.
When bringing one to a new home, let it grow freely for ~1 year.

## ‚òÄÔ∏èEnvironment 
This species makes a great indoor plant due to the fact that it thrives in warm, humid environments and can stand lower light conditions compared to other species.
However, there are some people that recommend leaving them outdoor under direct sunlight for a few hours a day during the summer to promote growth. It greatly benefits from outdoor exposure in warm weather. 
Morning or evening sun might be better than mid-day sun to protect the plant.
During its weakest season, the winter, it is best to try and place him under direct sunlight even if that implicates moving it from one room to another.
Shady locations are not great.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è [[Pruning]]
Pruning a bonsai is a bit more than just cutting leaves.
If the goal is to thicken/strengthen the branches, the best is **not** to prune.
The reason for this is that if there is no intervention, letting them grow *crazy* is the best way to strengthen the branches. After that, it can be pruned in a way that it'll allow the bonsai to throw buds everywhere. Only then can the leaves be cut. Advanced "practitioners" recommend pruning back to 2 leaves after 6-8 leaves have grown. 

[This](https://www.evergreengardenworks.com/trunks.htm) is a good page to reference when it comes to developing large trunks (which is the core of any tree, really).
[This](https://bonsai4me.com/developing-informal-upright-trunks-for-deciduous-bonsai/)  one is more specific because it focus on developing upright trunks.

## [[Wiring & supporting]]
When it comes to wiring/bending: thin to medium branches are easy to work on due to their flexibility. Wires **should be checked regularly** because they can cut into the bark very quickly damaging the tree; strong branches should be shaped with guy-wires (I don't really know the translation to portuguese) as they can last longer.

## üíß [[Watering]]
As with most plants, the best way to check if it needs water is to stick a finger in the dirt and see if it is humid.
General rule of thumb, these trees are watered every week/week and a half.

## [[Fertilizing]]
When it comes to fertilizing, the interval between doses depends on the season. I am currently fertilizing every 2 weeks during the summer and every 4 weeks during the winter if I don't see any growth or every 3 weeks if I can see growth.
I've only tested the ratio of fertilizer I usually do which is ~1:100.
This, however, depends on the ratio of NPK the fertilizer indicates and the recommended application rate.

## üå±[[Re-potting]]
This is a pretty big thing when it comes to bonsai trees, you're giving them a whole new house.
This should be done every other year, during the spring, with proper soil mixture. From what I've read, they tolerate root-pruning well.
