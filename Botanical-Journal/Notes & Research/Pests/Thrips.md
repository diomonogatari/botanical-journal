| 🐞 **Biocontrol**       | Outdoors: introduce ladybugs or predatory mites if infestation persists     |
| 🧹 **Hygiene**          | Remove plant debris and keep area tidy — prevents egg-laying & population buildup |

## ⚠️ Notes

- Thrips **lay eggs inside leaf tissue**, so repeated treatments are needed.
- **Do not compost** infected material — eggs or nymphs can persist.
- Ideal conditions for thrips: **warm, dry, low-airflow** microclimates — typical of indoor or crowded balcony spaces.
